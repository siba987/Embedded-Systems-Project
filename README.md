# Embedded-Systems-Project
For this project, we used a DS Robot which comprises of a 51duino Mainboard, four DC motors, a Wi-fi module for communication, and an on-board camera.

Our tasks for this project were divided into four parts: firstly, we ensured that we were able to manually control the robot; then, there was the go-to-goal task where the robot must go from any initial pose to any target pose. The third task is to have the robot follow another one, i.e. a leader-follower model, and optimize the experimental procedure by either minimizing the distance or the time required for the robot to reach point B from A. In the final Trajectory tracking task, the robot must follow a pre-specified trajectory within an optimum amount of time.

The folder includes the code for the three parts, including the log files for the path and trajectory tracking tasks. Also included are the setup instructions, final report, and demo videos for the project.
